Slannan is more than just yet another bug tracker. It solves an inherent issue with keeping track of errors and glitches.

Since the advent of computer science, programmers have kept logs of their project’s bugs. However, they were left with a long list of errors. Since bugs were all being lumped into one category, a programmer would have to guess at priority. One could easily spend two weeks on a minor bug, not realizing that another, more pressing bug, required more immediate attention. Similarly, hacking away at a bug list, only to resolve two major issues, could appear far less significant than resolving eight minor ones, when really it was the other way around.

Slannan presents a groundbreaking alternative to this. It is the first bug tracker to use the “Heston Scale”, a method by which bugs are assigned a severity score, and with it, a clear-cut priority.

This bug tracker is designed as a local-based application, providing a tool for small teams and lone wolf programmers that doesn’t require a server. All data is stored in small project files (.hes) which can easily be transferred between computers.
