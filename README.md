# Slannan

A local-based bug tracker. This is the old, original source code - the project had quite a few serious bugs that we were
never able to fix. Nevertheless, it is unique and shows promise as a useful application, but we want to rethink a few
things. We'll be revisiting the design of the software somewhere down the line. In the meantime, you're welcome to run
it from the Python source if you're feeling adventurous.
